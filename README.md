My Creation of a SimpleEQ audio plugin, 
following  Makat Music's guideline in mind, 
utilizing the JUCE Framework. 
This plugin introduces parametric audio filters 
for precise sound shaping and incorporates a spectrum analyzer 
through real-time FFT data generation in modern C++. 

SimpleEQ empowers users to sculpt their sound and visualize 
frequency spectrums with ease, catering to the needs of 
musicians, producers, and sound designers.
